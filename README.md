## Decision Tree Model for Codetech Internship Task 1

This repository contains the solution for Task 1 of the Codetech Internship. The task involves building a Decision Tree model to perform data analysis, including data preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

## Description

In this project, we implement a Decision Tree model using Python and scikit-learn. The model is designed to handle a dataset, preprocess the data, train a decision tree classifier, and evaluate its performance. This task aims to demonstrate how machine learning can be applied to solve real-world problems.

## Requirements

Before running the code, ensure that the required dependencies are installed:

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib (optional, for data visualization)
  - seaborn (optional, for data visualization)

You can install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
